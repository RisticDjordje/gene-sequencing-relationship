# Gene sequencing relationships finder using Dynamic Programming and Levenshtein Distance.

Finding the Genealogy tree from a set of gene sequences that have a small probability of insertion, deletion and mutation using both a local and global algorithmic approaches that use Dynamic Programming and Levenshtein distance. This was one of my projects for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
